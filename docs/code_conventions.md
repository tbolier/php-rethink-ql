# Code conventions

We value quality. Because everyone can contribute we have created some guidelines.

# Naming conventions

1. Interfaces MUST be suffixed by Interface: e.g. `TBolier\Foo\QueryInterface`.
2. Abstract classes MUST be prefixed by Abstract: e.g. `TBolier\Foo\AbstractQuery`.
3. Traits MUST be suffixed by Trait: e.g. `TBolier\Foo\QueryTrait`.
4. PSR-1, 2 and 4 MUST be followed.
5. The vendor namespace MUST be `TBolier`.

# Code standards and principles

1. The [PHP-FIG PHP Standards Recommendations](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) (PSR-1, 2 and 4) MUST be followed.
2. Create understandable, flexible and maintainable code by using the [Solid Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) as a set of guidelines.
3. Use [Composite over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) as a guideline.
4. Create integration and unit tests for your fixes and code contributions.

Thank you!
